    Compute cosine similarity between keywords and each special

    Use tqdm to print a progress bar in terminal
    
    TODO
    takes 2.5 secs/file, 2:15 for one query
        is there a faster way?

    integrate name of special into recs, maybe with a higher level of importance
        bag of words for similarity of title

    alternative to cosine similarity?
        TS-SS, however cost may be much higher

    compute cosine similarity as one large matrix calc?
        vectors to multiply would be very large - probs not worth it

    shorter documents tend to get precendence over longer ones?
        politically correct language is relatively short
